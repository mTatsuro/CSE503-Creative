# CSE330 Interactive CSE330 Wiki
You are reading thorough the CSE330 wiki and you have some questions. Now you will have to open Piazza and reference the part of wiki you have questions on. Not anymore! With our interactive CSE330 wiki, users (students) can highlight important parts, share highlights, and post questions specific to those highlights. While students can also answer those questions, moderators (instructors) can answer and delete comments.
