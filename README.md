# Interactive Webpage
Interactive website which allows users (students) to highlight important parts, share highlights, and post questions specific to those highlights. While users can also answer those questions, moderators (instructors) can answer and delete comments. Used React frontend and NodeJS Express backend. Implemented for a school project. 

- When a user highlights text in the webpage, a small pop-up window stating comment shows up. Clicking this window sends the user to highlights page.
- There is a public version of a webpage where anyone can view, but no one can highlight.
- The website is secured by controlling the routing. That is, the website keeps track of the page the user was previously at, preventing malicious attackers from directly accessing the private pages.
